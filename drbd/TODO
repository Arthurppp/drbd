My TODO list:

1) David`s Points, most of them should be easy to fix...
2) Remove the "BlkSizeChanged" packet from the protocol, since it is redundant.
3) I got some messages from ReiserFS on 2.2.14:
                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 155664
                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 172048
                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 204814

                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 311312

                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 81934
                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 262154
                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 1
                   buffer-300: BAD, count is 1 for buffer 24591
   this happened at unmunt, and it`s always about the same number of these
   messages, independent of drbd`s size.
   Unfortunately I can not remember which protocol I used ...
4) On 2.3.x it is possible to have a private request-queue (instead of
   all_requests), we should definitely use this feature. Then we can 
   leave NBD`s major number alone.
5) 2.3.x. Dev-fs support
6) Now there are two places where we do IO without using the buffercache.
   (in do_request() when reading/writing and in the syncer when reading)
   It we are starting with GFS support we will need to write on the
   secondary`s side without using the buffercache. Thus if would be nice if
   we had some generic do_IO_without_buffercache() functions, that we could
   use from all that places.
7) If it`s in WFConnection, it should try to connect every x seconds. x is
   tunable by drbdsetup.
8) If there is nothing to send the primary should send every y seconds a 
   keep-alive-packet. (y is tunable by drbdsetup) 
   If the is no packet for more than y seconds the secondary close()s the
   connection.
9) GFS support. 
   I think we should introduce two new states: GPrimary and GSecondary
   Both states give you full R/W access. If the connection
   is lost, the GSecondary is blocking every IO-request until is has 
   a new connection or until the manager (heartbeat?) puts it into 
   GPrimary.
   Whe the connection is lost the node in GPrimary continues to work.
   Another important question is how, GFS`s lock-daeon handles the
   connection lost cast.
10) Use Thomas Mangin's datadisk script
11) The bitmap syncer is not working flawless on alpha. It is working on 
    intel.

DONE:
