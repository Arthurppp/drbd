	  Drbd is a block device which is designed to build high availability
	  clusters.  This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a
	  dedicated) network.  You could see it as a network RAID 1.

	  This device replaces the regular "network block device".

	  Each device (drbd provides more than one of these devices) has a
	  state, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'. On the node with the
	  primary device the application is supposed to run and to access the
	  device (/dev/nbX). Every write is sent to the local 'lower level
	  block device' and to the node with the device in 'secondary' state.
	  The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower level block
	  device. Reads are always carried out locally.

	  Drbd management is done through user-space tools.

comment "DRBD in kernel, no NBD possible"

comment "Note: you can _not_ load both NBD and DRBD modules at the same time"
