There is a new timeout. If the primary node cannot send (TCP!)
within the timeout, it falls back into unconnected operation.

You can also disable the timeout (by setting it to zero), but in
case of a failure of the secondary node, your primary node will block!

Currently the timeout is hardcoded into drbdsetup (3 Seconds).

This time I worked a lot looking into all possible deadlocks...
I think if you do not use any loop-back device it should
work without deadlocking. It is not working on top of the loop
block device and it is not working via the loop-back network!

This time it should handle all block size issues, and thus
reiserfs is feeling happy on top of drbd.



Status of drbd-0.1.tar.gz
-------------------------

This is a proof-it-is-no-vapo-ware-release and not more!
It is the first time it is somehow working without immediately crashing
my machine (you can "even" unload the module). It is not able to 
handle blocksized other than 1024 and there is not a single line of code
of the sync-a-new-secondary stuff yet.
The used port is hardcoded into drbdsetup (7788) for now.
I have tested it on an intel box and an alpha machine.
