Hello.

Those script are done to manage you drbd cluster without pain.
I hope it will work for you.

At install time, the drbd and datadisk script will be installed
and then linked in the /etc/(rc.d)/init.d directory.

You will have to type :
> chkconfig drbd on
> chkconfig datadisk on
to have it start at boot time automaticly.

drbdc is a administration script. see drbdc help.
datadisk is a script are for integration of drbd with heartbeat.
It can be used as a stand alone program as well. It will now
accept three different dehaviouring mode.

Check the sample example file for more information.
