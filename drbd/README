Unfortunately my time does not allow me to maintain this README besides
the software. 

Please refer to the web page 
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/reisner/drbd
to find maintained information.

Reference documentation is included in the documentation directory.


DEBUGING:

In case you experience kernel crashes when using DRBD, please
recompile DRBD and set the DEBUGFLAGS in Makefile.vars to -DDEBUG.

Run the oops through ksyms and send it to the DRBD mailinglist.
