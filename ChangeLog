9.0.2-1 (api:genl2/proto:86-111/transport:14)
--------
 * Fix list walks on the transfer log; Lead to crashes in _tl_restart()
   and (sometimes) other places.
 * Fix a corner case that lead to nodes showing the disk states of
   other nodes as Outdated after resync
 * Fix waiting for barrier acks; The bug was that demoting to secondary
   after AHEAD/BEHIND may blocked forever
 * Fix WRITE_SAME support
 * Fix a possible OOPS in got_peer_ack()
 * Fix resync controller; Was always on c-min-rate
 * Fix a possible deadlock on disconnect
 * Use modern kernel's expclicit plugging to reduce number of IOPs on
   the secondary node
 * Introduce a per resource max-io-depth limit; applies to each volume
   in the resource
 * Promptly send peer_acks if we can put the last reference on an
   activity log entry. Helps the to get the AL in use on secondaries
   down.

9.0.1-1 (api:genl2/proto:86-111/transport:14)
--------
 * Fix ahead/behind mode: spinlock deadlock when entering and resync afterwards
 * Fix crash in online verify
 * Fix crash when receiving pages on a diskless node
 * Fix issues with resize when more than two nodes are present
 * Many minor fixes
 * Work on the multi-path support; the TCP transport now tries all paths while
   connecting, afterwards it uses one path
 * The RDMA transport supports multiple paths and can use them in parallel
 * Configuration option to make resync thinly provisioned storage
   friendly: rs-discard-granularity
 * Make sure it compiles with Linux 4.4
 * Merge changes from the 8.4.7 release
 * Fix a preformance regression of 8.4.0; it got worse with bigger devices;
   really significant above 1TByte

9.0.0-3 (api:genl2/proto:86-110/transport:10)
--------
 * Fixes for the RDMA transport
 * Fixes for 8.4 compatibility
 * Merge changes from the 8.4.6 release

9.0.0 (api:genl2/proto:86-110)
--------
 * split drbdsetup connect into new-peer, add-path, connect;
   split disconnect into del-path, disconnect and del-peer
 * create a new configuration object 'peer-device'; move config
   params of resync to the peer-device
 * a transport abstraction layer that will allow for alternative
   transports besides TCP. Planed are RDMA/Infiniband and SCTP
 * moved the user space code to a dedicated repository (with
   that the driver no longer uses autotools)
 * drbdsetup events2 supersedes events; drbdsetup status supersedes
   cat /proc/drbd; both commands are also available with drbd 8.4.6
   and recent drbd-utils
 * Fixed the wait-[connect|sync] drbdadm commands. Now they actually
   work on all three object types (resources, connections, volumes)
 * New command called "forget-peer". It is used to free a peer-device
   slot. Online (via drbdsetup) or offline (via drbdmeta)
 * Introduced two phase commits that span include all (direct
   and indirectly) connected nodes. This new type of transactions
   is used when a node bacomes primary, or when a new connection
   is established.
 * Reworked resync decisions for multiple connections, and weakly
   connected nodes.
 * Support for multiple connections in a single resource; this feature
   obsoletes device stacking; new configuration keywords: connection,
   host, node-id, connection-mesh, hosts.
 * Automatic promote; if a process opens a drbd device for r/w, drbd
   tries to promotes that resource to primary; if the last process
   closes the device drbd demotes that resource to secondary; opens
   fails if promotion fails. This feature obsoletes become-primary-on
 * Activity log striping; Besides the striping this allows AL
   sizes of up to 65536.
 * Non blocking queuing of AL-updates; This change significantly
   improves the number of IOPs in case the workload does not fit into
   the configured AL size.
 * Resync extents are now 128MiByte instead of 16MiBytes
 * Use git submodules to share code between drbd core, user-space
   tools and drbd transports
 * a dedicated disk state for Detaching (previously Failed was
   used for a detaching disk)
