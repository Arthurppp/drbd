 * Merge changes from the 8.4.7 release

9.0.0-3 (api:genl2/proto:86-110/transport:10)
--------
 * Fixes for the RDMA transport
 * Fixes for 8.4 compatibility
 * Merge changes from the 8.4.6 release

9.0.0 (api:genl2/proto:86-110)
--------
 * split drbdsetup connect into new-peer, add-path, connect;
   split disconnect into del-path, disconnect and del-peer
 * create a new configuration object 'peer-device'; move config
   params of resync to the peer-device
 * a transport abstraction layer that will allow for alternative
   transports besides TCP. Planed are RDMA/Infiniband and SCTP
 * moved the user space code to a dedicated repository (with
   that the driver no longer uses autotools)
 * drbdsetup events2 supersedes events; drbdsetup status supersedes
   cat /proc/drbd; both commands are also available with drbd 8.4.6
   and recent drbd-utils
 * Fixed the wait-[connect|sync] drbdadm commands. Now they actually
   work on all three object types (resources, connections, volumes)
 * New command called "forget-peer". It is used to free a peer-device
   slot. Online (via drbdsetup) or offline (via drbdmeta)
 * Introduced two phase commits that span include all (direct
   and indirectly) connected nodes. This new type of transactions
   is used when a node bacomes primary, or when a new connection
   is established.
 * Reworked resync decisions for multiple connections, and weakly
   connected nodes.
 * Support for multiple connections in a single resource; this feature
   obsoletes device stacking; new configuration keywords: connection,
   host, node-id, connection-mesh, hosts.
 * Automatic promote; if a process opens a drbd device for r/w, drbd
   tries to promotes that resource to primary; if the last process
   closes the device drbd demotes that resource to secondary; opens
   fails if promotion fails. This feature obsoletes become-primary-on
 * Activity log striping; Besides the striping this allows AL
   sizes of up to 65536.
 * Non blocking queuing of AL-updates; This change significantly
   improves the number of IOPs in case the workload does not fit into
   the configured AL size.
 * Resync extents are now 128MiByte instead of 16MiBytes
 * Use git submodules to share code between drbd core, user-space
   tools and drbd transports
 * a dedicated disk state for Detaching (previously Failed was
   used for a detaching disk)
